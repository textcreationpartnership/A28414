            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Before that moſt worthy Perſon Sir <hi>William Turner</hi> (one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace) about 12. of the Clock on <hi>Fryday</hi> Night, who Committed that great Robbery and Murther in the Houſe of his Maſter Eſquire <hi>Bluck</hi> in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> on the Fifth of this Inſtant <hi>August</hi> laſt paſt, with the manner of his Deportment before that worthy Perſon aforeſaid, having been three hours upon Examination, before he would make any Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Juſtice, (ſeeing he would not Confeſs) ſent to ſearch the Houſe where he Lodged, where, upon the ſeach thereof, was found one Trunk of Plate and other Rich Commodities, which no ſooner was brought in before the Juſtice, but he confeſt both the Robbery and that Blood-Murther, whereupon he was Committed to <hi>Newgate.</hi>

               <p>BEing brought upon Suſpicion of this great Robbery and Murder, before the Juſtice, and being charged with the Fact, utterly denyed it. The queſtion being asked where he had beſtowed his time ſince he left his Maſters Service, to which he replied that he had been in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that he came laſt from <hi>Dover,</hi> and arrived here on Munday laſt, and had taken a Lodging in <hi>White-croſs</hi>-Street. But b ing further urged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter of Fact, ſtill denied it: whereupon a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there preſent that lived near to the Houſe of his Maſter, (Eſquire <hi>Bluck</hi>) which was the inſtrumental perſon of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended teſtified that he brought two or three Razors to his Shop to be Ground: and ſeeing this Mrs. <hi>Burt n</hi> deſired her being an old acquaintance to drink with him, which ſhe did, and after ſome time departed: and on Wedneſday towards the Evening he came again to this Razor-grinders Shop, and this Mrs. <hi>Burton</hi> ſitting at her Maſters Dore, he asked her to drink a pot of Ale, which ſhe accepted of, deſiring him to come in and ſit down in the Paſſage: which was between the Parlour and the Kitchen, after they had done he ſaid he was in great haſt to be gon: but the poor woman (not imagining he had ſuch Cruelty lodged within his Breſt) deſired him to ſtay longer, for it was time enough to go home, whereupon ſome words did ariſe between them as he ſaid, and deſiring him to go into the Kitchen, going along he ſtrook her a blow on the head with which ſhe fell down.</p>
               <p>Then he ſeeing the Body ſtrugling on the ground, he took a Green Carpet that lay on the Table, and threw over her, and ſo left her, and went and broke open all the Trucks and Boxes-in the Houſe, out of which he took the Plate, being Tankards, Cups, Plates, Fruit Diſhes, and other Plate, to the Value of between two and three hundred pounds; a Silver, Hilted Sword, and a Camlit Cloak, out of which he carried away nineteen Spoons and Forks, a Fruit-diſh; a Tankard, the Cloak and the Sword, and left the remaining part in one of the Chimnies, and ſo he Departed; all which he denied before that Sir <hi>William Turner</hi> ſent to ſearch his Lodging, where they found the Trunck, and when that was brought into his ſight, he declared all the foregoing Story, and ſeemed to be very much troubled and very Penitent, and ſaid, he would have brought the Plate again but was afraid of being Apprehended, on Thurſday he ſaid he was walking in the Fields, and on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night came again to the Razor Grinders Shop who having
<pb facs="tcp:50572:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>heard of this Bloody Murther, and knowing of no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have been there but only him, ſent immediately for the Conſtable and brought him before Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> and there making this his Confeſſion was committed to Newgate, where we leave him to the Mercy of God and the Judicious Court of Juſtice to anſwer for this his Bloody Crime,</p>

               <p>HE that hereafter ſhall undertake truly to blazon forth this bruitiſh Age to the eyes of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, can expreſs it no way better than by froathy ſtreams of ſcarlet gore, thwarting a field of black, of deeper die (if it may be) than the long Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian night. <hi>Melpomene</hi> muſt give place, and as too much agaſt at the more than tragical events of our times, remit her trembling Poets to the Infernal furies, whoſe flaming whips would be the beſt pens to deſcribe ſuch Stygian exploits, which now the hardned Sun like ordinary things beholds, whereas far leſs crimes have formerly made him veil his more baſhful face. If the World may rightly be ſaid to have run through four Ages, which according, their ſeveral tempers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the ſignificant epithets of Gold, Silver, Braſs, and Iron; when we ſee then the wickedneſs of ours ſo monſtrouſly tranſcend that of the former, what can we collect from thence, but that we are entred into a fefth, yielding ſo prodigious an increaſe of vices, that it deſerves not as other, to be denominated by any mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in that firſt ventricle of the Earth, where <hi>Pluto</hi> hides his precious dirt, but rather from its moſt infernal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that very diſmal Center where Grim <hi>Pluto</hi>'s horrid Chair is ſet; from whence, as if ſome of that Tyrant's more officious Pioneers had lately wrought through an open paſſage, legions of evils aſſail us, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50572:3"/>thoſe Owl-vices which before revered, now truſting in their numbers, out-dare the light. For certainly, if it goes on with ſo numerous a ſuperfaetation of Monſters as it has begun, there will not only want room in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to place them, but there will want Writers too to inſert them; no humane creature, but ſuch Devils as act them, being able to expreſs the helliſh actions now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated on the ſtage of the World. You Galiants may now ſave your mony, and you Players turn Spectators; you need not now, Gentlemen Poets, wrack your brains to invent new, or revive old Tragedies, ſince now ones are ſo rife; you need not amuſe your ſelves with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or imaginary cruelties, when Hell having as it ſeems removed purpoſely into our upper Regions to divert you, daily preſents you real ones; and ſtill further to humour the lunacy of your fancies, every moment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters its ſcenes, dreſſes, and ſubjects. So many ſtrange Robberies, unheard-of Curelties, ſavage Murders, and Bloudy Exploits continually alarming our ſenſes, that our eyes are ſcarcely well fitted with amazement at one ſtrange event, but they are recalled the more prodigious horror of a new accident, from whoſe multiplying num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers we may well conclude, that now, if ever, the great Deceiver is let looſe, with all his praeſtigious devices, to make us the ſad actors of our own ruine. For the earth has hardly covered the laſt blood with which, in this kind, you heard its unnatural children beſmeared her face; the ink is hardly dry that moiſtned its dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful narrative: when behold, new villanies of no leſs ſcarlet hue diſplay themſelves, which, though I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expreſs with all the horrid circumſtances attending
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50572:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>it are beſt known to the helliſh actors, and their ſubtil Cur, from whoſe cabal they had their peculiar inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet I ſhall give ſuch a delineation as a trembling hand is able in ſuch a paroxiſm of aſtoniſhment as the tragicalneſs of ſo doleful a ſubject muſt needs cauſe.</p>
               <p>This long Vacation having rendred many employs here in Town at preſent uſeleſs, and to moſt ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the buſineſs and care that the other ſeaſons of the year keep in ure both their minds and bodies; and the pleaſantneſs now of the Country inviting them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides for variety as well as refreſhments ſake, to lay by their City recreations for rural divertiſements, where <hi>Flora</hi> and <hi>Ceres</hi> ſeem both to contend, one with her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly embroidered flowery plains, and enamelled hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks; and the other with her richer, becauſe ponderous and truly golden treſſes of barbed Corn, who ſhould moſt beſt careſs, and moſt magnificently entertain the Citizen gueſt; I ſay whilſt this pleaſant ſeaſon in its uſual return had amongſt others invited the wealthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this unhappy houſe, the fatal ſcene of our preſent Tragedy, whilſt they pleaſed themſelvs in ſeeing the joyful Husband-men ſhaving the rich looks of their mother earth; the Devil and his Factors was it ſeems (as he uſually is) as buſy here to make his Harveſt in the Sun-ſhine of their ſecurity, and to deſpoil them of that wealth which no queſtion were the fruits of many years induſtry. So treacherous and unſure are all earthly pleaſures and enjoyments, that when we think our ſelves moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50572:4"/>people going for ſome time into the Country, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Guard of their too well lined Manſion, only one Gentle woman, whoſe carefulneſs and fidelity they conſidered more intertively than her weakneſs, they by this means gave a notable opportunity to the Harpies of the Town to ſeize their wealth: for thoſe whoſe minds hanker after Golden Apples, are rather invited than ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when ſuch feeble Dragons are ſet to keep them. And certainly, if occaſion ever made a thief, 'twas here; for thoſe perhaps which dared not to deſign ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt when the houſe was full, knew full well to time an opportunity when given them, which it ſeems they did to an hair: for whilſt there remained two men in the houſe with the ſaid Gentlewoman, this hell-hatcht plot durſt not peep, but no ſooner (upon what occaſion I know not) were they departed, and forbore to lie in the houſe, but the very next night, when this poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Gentlewoman having diſcharged her duty with that care which became her truſt, and being gone to bed, there to ſuch reflections as uſually quiet conſciences af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honeſt, labours bleſs the ſouls of their owner withal, ſhe was miſerably ſurprized by ſome as yet unknown perſons, whoſe names as yet remain unmasked in the darkneſs of ignorance, as their faces were then in the obſcurity of the night, who barbarouſly ſeizing on her, whoſe life was the only obſtacle between them and the inticing pelf they ſo helliſhly coveted, did butcher-like ſlaſh her under the ear, and left her a liveleſs example of their execrable curelty. And leaving her weltring in her own gore, they proceeded to break open all the Cheſts, Trunks, and Boxes they could find, taking of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50572:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>their bowels, a ſpoil, whoſe value though yet unknown, cannot but be ſuppoſed very conſiderable, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable enough for thoſe appetites, who after having gorged themſelves with bloud, could not eaſily be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with Gold or Silver, for not content with that, they in a moſt lamentable and unheard of manner ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked and rifled the whole houſe, and taking what-ever they could poſſibly carry away, diſordered the reſt, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where making either a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or a <hi>Chaos,</hi> that by the remaining works of their ſancys it was too ſadly viſible what ravenous vermine had been there.</p>
               <p>In a word, after they had rather wearied and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded their bodies with ſpoil and pelf, than ſated their unſatiable avarice or glutted their ſavage appetites with cruelty, exactly like Owls, Birds of Darkneſs as they were, apprehending the riſing of that bright Morning Tapor, and fearing diſcovery, they took their flight from this miſerable houſe, and retired into ſome place where as yet the deluding Impoſtor their Maſter, has ſecured them and their booty from diſcovery, although endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with utmoſt induſtry are uſed to trace them. God give to their purſuers Eagles eyes to deſcry, and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures claws to lay hold on theſe notorious Malefactors, that ſo the terror of all ſuch Heaven affronting Varlets, who contemning all Laws Divine and Humane, will, if let alone, deſtroy all our rights, and by invading their neighbours peculiars, bring all Societies, and the whole World to its firſt <hi>Chaos</hi> and confuſion, they may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Juſtice, and be brought to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, thoſe who ſhall chance to read or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50572:5"/>hear of this ſtrange and doleful accident, may make this uſe of it: Let them conſider how happy the owners of this houſe and goods ſome few days ago thought themſelves; how ſecure they thought themſelves poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of their wealth, whereas now a great loſs has ſuddenly like a Thunder-clap diſcharged it ſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſhaken their happineſs, whilſt they ſecurely, and it may be innocently followed their pleaſures in the Country, that little dreamt what a ſtorm threatned them from the City: you ſee then the frailty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of worldly things, what a ſudden change pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can make. Let him that ſtands then, never think himſelf ſo ſure, but let him have a care of a fall: never let us pride our ſelves ſo much in any thing here, or think our ſelves ſo well fortified, but let our thoughts reach further, let us in prudence take all care to ſecure our bleſſings, but when all is done, let us be prepared for a loſs, which none of us but may, after all care and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom imaginable, expect, as long as we live in a fleeting World, which is ſuch a floating Sea of troubles, that amidſt ſuch waves no ſure footing can be fixed.</p>
